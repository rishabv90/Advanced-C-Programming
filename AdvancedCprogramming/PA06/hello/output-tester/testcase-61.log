Testcase 61
   Testing: SparseNode_copy(a1)
   Built array a1:
   (4,20)->(40000,3)
                    ->(6,5)->(30,-7)
         ->(2,22)
                 ->(0,100)->(1,-30)
   Copy Node:
   Student result after copy:
   (4,20)->(40000,3)
                    ->(6,5)->(30,-7)
         ->(2,22)
                 ->(0,100)->(1,-30)
   Solution result after copy:
   (4,20)->(40000,3)
                    ->(6,5)->(30,-7)
         ->(2,22)
                 ->(0,100)->(1,-30)
   Checking if result tree is the same...
Pass.
