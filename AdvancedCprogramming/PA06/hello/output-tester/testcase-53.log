Testcase 53
   Testing: SparseNode_remove(a1)
   Built array a1:
   (4,20)->(40000,3)
                    ->(6,5)->(30,-7)
         ->(2,22)
                 ->(0,100)->(1,-30)
   Remove Node with index 2:
   Student result after remove:
   (4,20)->(40000,3)
                    ->(6,5)->(30,-7)
         ->(0,100)->(1,-30)
   Solution result after remove:
   (4,20)->(40000,3)
                    ->(6,5)->(30,-7)
         ->(0,100)->(1,-30)
   Checking if result tree is the same...
Pass.
