Testcase 57
   Testing: SparseNode_remove(a5)
   Built array a5:
   (1,5)->(10,3)->(25,3)
                        ->(11,-4)
                ->(8,4)
                       ->(4,-30)->(7,20)
   Remove Node with index 10:
   Student result after remove:
   (1,5)->(11,-4)->(25,3)
                 ->(8,4)
                        ->(4,-30)->(7,20)
   Solution result after remove:
   (1,5)->(11,-4)->(25,3)
                 ->(8,4)
                        ->(4,-30)->(7,20)
   Checking if result tree is the same...
Pass.
