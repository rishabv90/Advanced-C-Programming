Testcase 72
   Testing: SparseNode_merge(a4)
   Built array_1 a0:
   (1,5)->(3,3)->(8,4)
        ->(0,6)
   Built array_2 a1:
   (4,20)->(40000,3)
                    ->(6,5)->(30,-7)
         ->(2,22)
                 ->(0,100)->(1,-30)
   Merge Node:
   Student result after merge:
   (1,-25)->(3,3)->(8,4)->(40000,3)
                                   ->(30,-7)
                        ->(4,20)->(6,5)
                 ->(2,22)
          ->(0,106)
   Solution result after merge:
   (1,-25)->(3,3)->(8,4)->(30,-7)->(40000,3)
                        ->(6,5)
                               ->(4,20)
                 ->(2,22)
          ->(0,106)
   Checking if result tree is the same...
Pass.
