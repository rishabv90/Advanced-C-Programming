   Testing: SparseNode_merge(a1)
   Built array_1 a1:
   (4,20)->(40000,3)
                    ->(6,5)->(30,-7)
         ->(2,22)
                 ->(0,100)->(1,-30)
   Built array_2 a5:
   (1,5)->(10,3)->(25,3)
                        ->(11,-4)
                ->(8,4)
                       ->(4,-30)->(7,20)
   Merge Node:
   Student result after merge:
   (4,-10)->(40000,3)
                     ->(6,5)->(30,-7)
                                     ->(10,3)->(25,3)
                                                     ->(11,-4)

          ->(2,22)
                  ->(0,100)->(1,-25)
   Solution result after merge:
   (4,-10)->(40000,3)
                     ->(6,5)->(30,-7)
                                     ->(7,20)->(8,4)->(11,-4)->(25,3)
                                                             ->(10,3)
          ->(2,22)
                  ->(0,100)->(1,-25)
   Checking if result tree is the same...
Pass.
