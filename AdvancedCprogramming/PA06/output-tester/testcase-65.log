Testcase 65
   Testing: SparseNode_copy(a5)
   Built array a5:
   (1,5)->(10,3)->(25,3)
                        ->(11,-4)
                ->(8,4)
                       ->(4,-30)->(7,20)
   Copy Node:
   Student result after copy:
   (1,5)->(10,3)->(25,3)
                        ->(11,-4)
                ->(8,4)
                       ->(4,-30)->(7,20)
   Solution result after copy:
   (1,5)->(10,3)->(25,3)
                        ->(11,-4)
                ->(8,4)
                       ->(4,-30)->(7,20)
   Checking if result tree is the same...
Pass.
