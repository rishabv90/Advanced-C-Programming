Testcase 62
   Testing: SparseNode_copy(a2)
   Built array a2:
   (50,4)->(75,-3)->(80,-30)
                  ->(60,-7)
         ->(25,7)->(30,80)
                 ->(12,9)
   Copy Node:
   Student result after copy:
   (50,4)->(75,-3)->(80,-30)
                  ->(60,-7)
         ->(25,7)->(30,80)
                 ->(12,9)
   Solution result after copy:
   (50,4)->(75,-3)->(80,-30)
                  ->(60,-7)
         ->(25,7)->(30,80)
                 ->(12,9)
   Checking if result tree is the same...
Pass.
